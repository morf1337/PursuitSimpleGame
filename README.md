**Game rules**:
1. Each participant (player and enemies) may make one move. Then, it's another participant's turn. The enemy is considered to have reached the player if it can step on the player's position by making the current move.
2. Available movement directions are left, right, downward, and upward.
3. If an enemy is unable to move forward (there are obstacles or other enemies around them, or a map edge has been reached), the enemy skips a move.
4. The target point is an obstacle for an enemy.
5. If the player is unable to move forward (surrounded by obstacles, enemies, or has reached an edge of the map), the player loses the game.
6. The player loses if an enemy finds them before they reach the target point.
7. The player starts the game first.
